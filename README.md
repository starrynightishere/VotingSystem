This is a simple Python GUI application using tkinter that simulates a fun election for the best cartoon representative. Users can vote for their favorite cartoon character from a list of candidates, including Oggy and the Cockroaches, Pokemon, Chhota Bheem, Mr. Bean, Doremon, and Ninja Hatthori. Additionally, there is an option to vote for NOTA (None of the Above). After voting, the application displays the voting figures for each candidate and announces the winner based on the highest number of votes. The application includes images of the candidates and allows users to interactively vote for their favorite cartoon character.
